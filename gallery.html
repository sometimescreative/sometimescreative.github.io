                  <h2>Fox Tutoring Services Logo</h2>
                  <p>This was a logo I created for another fictional company, Fox Tutoring Services. Foxes are stereotypically known for being cunning and clever, so I figured it would make sense to use it for a logo relating to tutoring services. Initially the orange line underneath was a ruler, but the lines were an issue when the logo was made smaller, so I settled on a simple line instead. Created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
